## Clinical decision-making under uncertainty  
### Acute dyspnea in prehospital care

### Introduction

This document describes how real clinical decisions are made in the management of acute dyspnea in the prehospital setting.  
It is **not** a clinical guideline, a protocol, or an algorithmic proposal.

It is an **operational description** of decision-making as it occurs in practice, under conditions of uncertainty, time pressure, and limited information.

The purpose of this document is to establish a **realistic clinical framework** from which any decision support system — including those based on artificial intelligence — can be evaluated, designed, or integrated **without distorting professional responsibility or oversimplifying the environment**.

---

### Clinical context

Prehospital care is characterised by:

- limited access to objective clinical data,
- absence of complementary investigations,
- the need to act rapidly in potentially life-threatening situations.

Within this context, **acute dyspnea** represents one of the most challenging clinical presentations, given its wide range of possible aetiologies and the risk of rapid deterioration.

Decisions are made **sequentially and in parallel**, based on clinical observation, provisional hypotheses, and continuous reassessment.

Establishing a definitive diagnosis is **not** a prehospital objective; the priority is **patient stabilisation and safe transport** to the appropriate level of care.

---

### Real-world care flow

The initial approach focuses on scene safety and immediate recognition of clinically significant respiratory distress.

Primary assessment aims to identify life-threatening conditions and guide early interventions **without waiting for aetiological confirmation**.

Initial therapeutic measures may include:

- oxygen therapy,
- non-invasive ventilatory support,
- patient positioning,
- monitoring,
- pharmacological treatment guided by the most plausible working hypothesis at that moment.

Decisions are dynamic and subject to change as the patient’s condition evolves.

Clinical reassessment is continuous and directly influences:

- therapeutic adjustments,
- transport priority,
- destination selection.

Communication with the receiving facility is performed using **incomplete but clinically relevant information**, with explicit awareness of prehospital limitations.

---

### Clinical uncertainty

Prehospital practice operates intrinsically under conditions of uncertainty.

The underlying cause of acute dyspnea is often indeterminate at first contact.  
Different pathological processes may present with overlapping clinical features.  
An initial response to treatment does **not** guarantee a favourable course.

Uncertainty should not be interpreted as a system failure, but as a **defining characteristic of the environment**.

Clinical decision-making consists of:

- recognising uncertainty,
- managing it explicitly,
- maintaining continuous reassessment,
- avoiding prematurely definitive interpretations based on partial information.

---

### Clinical responsibility and governance

In the prehospital setting, **clinical responsibility rests entirely with the attending healthcare professional**.

Therapeutic decisions, transport prioritisation, and destination selection are **clinical acts that cannot be delegated or automated**.

Any decision support tool must integrate within this framework without altering responsibility attribution.

Its role, if present, is limited to:

- supporting clinical reasoning,
- structuring available information,
- highlighting potential risks,
- reinforcing reassessment.

It must **not** replace professional judgement or issue autonomous decisions.

Interpretability, traceability, and alignment with legal and clinical responsibility frameworks are **mandatory** for any viable integration.

### Scope of this document

This document does **not** propose technical solutions or predictive models.

Its sole purpose is to provide a **conceptual and operational reference grounded in real clinical practice**, intended to inform the design, evaluation, and critique of decision support systems in healthcare — particularly in prehospital care.
