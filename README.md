# Clinical decision-making under uncertainty  
## Acute dyspnea in prehospital care

### Introduction  
This document describes how real clinical decisions are made in the management of acute dyspnea in the prehospital setting. It is not a clinical guideline, a protocol, or an algorithmic proposal. It is an operational description of decision-making as it occurs in practice, under conditions of uncertainty, time pressure, and limited information.

The purpose of this document is to establish a realistic clinical framework from which any decision support system, including those based on artificial intelligence, can be evaluated, designed, or integrated without distorting professional responsibility or oversimplifying the complexity of the environment.

### Clinical context  
Prehospital care is characterised by limited access to objective clinical data, the absence of complementary investigations, and the need to act rapidly in potentially life-threatening situations. Within this context, acute dyspnea represents one of the most challenging clinical presentations, given its wide range of possible aetiologies and the risk of rapid deterioration.

Decisions are made both sequentially and in parallel, based on clinical observation, provisional hypotheses, and continuous reassessment. Establishing a definitive diagnosis is not a prehospital objective; the priority is patient stabilisation and safe transport to the appropriate level of care.

### Real-world care flow  
The initial approach focuses on scene safety and the immediate recognition of clinically significant respiratory distress. Primary assessment aims to identify life-threatening conditions and to guide early interventions without waiting for aetiological confirmation.

Initial therapeutic measures are implemented early and may include oxygen therapy, non-invasive ventilatory support, patient positioning, monitoring, and pharmacological treatment guided by the most plausible working hypothesis at that moment. These decisions are dynamic and subject to change as the patient’s condition evolves.

Clinical reassessment is continuous and directly influences both therapeutic adjustments and decisions regarding destination and transport priority. Communication with the receiving facility is performed using incomplete but clinically relevant information, with explicit awareness of the limitations inherent to the prehospital environment.

### Clinical uncertainty  
Prehospital practice operates intrinsically under conditions of uncertainty. The underlying cause of acute dyspnea is often indeterminate at the time of initial intervention, and different pathological processes may present with overlapping clinical features. The true severity of illness may not be immediately apparent, and an initial response to treatment does not guarantee a favourable course.

Uncertainty should not be interpreted as a system failure, but as a defining characteristic of the environment. Clinical decision-making consists of recognising this uncertainty, managing it explicitly, and maintaining the capacity for reassessment while avoiding prematurely definitive interpretations based on partial information.

### Clinical responsibility and governance  
In the prehospital setting, clinical responsibility rests entirely with the attending healthcare professional. Therapeutic decisions, transport prioritisation, and destination selection are clinical acts that cannot be delegated or automated.

Any decision support tool must integrate within this framework without altering responsibility attribution. Its role, if present, is limited to supporting clinical reasoning, structuring available information, highlighting potential risks, and reinforcing reassessment. It must not replace professional judgement or issue autonomous decisions.

The integration of decision support systems requires interpretability, traceability, and alignment with existing legal and clinical responsibility frameworks. Without these conditions, adoption in the prehospital setting lacks both clinical and operational viability.

### Scope of this document  
This document does not propose technical solutions or predictive models. Its sole purpose is to provide a conceptual and operational reference grounded in real clinical practice, intended to inform critical analysis of decision support systems in healthcare, particularly within prehospital care.
